***This Repository is no longer updated or maintained***
========================================================

I found it was getting unwieldy and wanted to slim things up and simplify, so my current active configuration can be found at https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon-config-take2.

I'm keeping this around for reference, and occasionally I do migrate some things from here that I find that I do actually miss, but in general, this repository should be considered outdated and any changes or modifications will be found at the new location.

*...And now back to your regularly scheduled README.md...*

Personal Configuration for Hammerspoon
======================================

My configuration files for Hammerspoon

Mostly random junk I find useful, a few tips and tricks that might be interesting, and a playground for the hamster running on the squeaky wheel of my brain.

Modules which aren't currently in the Hammerspoon core, and are also not in one of the sub-directories here, can most likely be found in one of the following places:

1. Luarocks (not so much anymore, but a few, maybe, especially if they're from Mjolnir...)
2. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm
3. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm.undocumented
