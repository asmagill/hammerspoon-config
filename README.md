Personal Configuration for Hammerspoon
======================================

My configuration files for Hammerspoon

Mostly random junk I find useful, a few tips and tricks that might be interesting, and a playground for the hamster running on the squeaky wheel of my brain.

Modules which aren't currently in the Hammerspoon core, and are also not in one of the sub-directories here, can most likely be found in one of the following places:

1. Luarocks (not so much anymore, but a few, maybe, especially if they're from Mjolnir...)
2. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm
3. https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm.undocumented
